# Asgardeo
A simple student login portal built using Next.js and WSO2 Asgardeo. This project includes secure user authentication with email/password and Google login. After signing in, users can access a protected dashboard. The system uses Asgardeo for identity management, user sessions, and OAuth2/OIDC-based authentication.
